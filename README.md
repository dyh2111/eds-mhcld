### Overview
This project leverages machine learning models to predict mental health disorders using client-level reporting data. The accompanying Jupyter notebook is optimized for use with Google Colab, allowing efficient management of the dataset's computational demands.

---

### Dataset
- **Original Data Source:** [SAMHSA Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/mh-cld/datafiles)
- A custom loading mechanism is included to download the filtered dataset as a CSV.

---

### Execution Instructions
1. Execute the Jupyter notebook from top to bottom for a seamless workflow.
2. Note: Some steps, such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), are resource-intensive and may take up to **15 minutes** on a GPU-enabled machine.

---

### Requirements
- A Google Colab environment with GPU acceleration enabled is highly recommended.
- Install required Python libraries listed in the included `requirements.txt` file.
